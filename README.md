# Ground State Preparation via Qubitization

In this notebook we run the experiment described in Sec. 4 of the paper 'Ground State Preparation via Qubitization' (arxiv:2306.XXXX). 
A quantum circuit is proposed to generate the imaginary time evolution of a single qubit system with Hamiltonian H = X, where X is the
Pauli-X operator.
